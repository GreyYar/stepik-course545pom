PyTest automation course practice task - Page Object Model  

Written and tested on `Python v3.7.3`

Run tests command: `pytest -v --tb=line --language=en test_main_page.py`

I've commented similar checks for `test_guest_can_add_product_to_cart` parameterized test.
Feel free to un-comment them if needed.

Review command: `pytest -v --tb=line --language=en -m need_review`

Thanks for your time :)  
  
P.S
Please notice that if you observe `ERROR:textfield.cc(1758) NOT IMPLEMENTED` error message - 
it could be related with chromedriver bug, which is not related with tests.
